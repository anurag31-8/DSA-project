Contact Book management system

**Project Description: Contact Book Management System**

The Contact Book Management System implemented in C++ is designed to efficiently manage contacts using a linked list data structure. This system allows users to perform fundamental contact management tasks such as adding, editing, deleting, and searching contacts.

Key features of the system include:

Add Contacts: Users can input contact details including name and phone number.
Edit Contacts: Modify existing contact information as needed.
Delete Contacts: Remove contacts individually or clear all contacts from the list.
Search Contacts: Find contacts by name or phone number.
Display Contacts: View all contacts sorted alphabetically by name.
The project demonstrates practical implementation skills in C++ programming, proficiency in managing dynamic data structures like linked lists, and competence in file handling for data persistence. It provides a straightforward solution for organizing and maintaining contact information effectively.
